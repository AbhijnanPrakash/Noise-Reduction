# Noise-Reduction
Noise reduction is the technique involved in extraction of the desired information from a signal.The received signal is usually a mixture of information and noise. It is important to reduce the attenuation caused by random noise, since it produces the errors in information and lowers quality of the signal. One of the most challenging problems in digital signal processing is to extract the original information from a signal without any loss.
The filter is a device which shapes the signal waveform in a desired manner. The main purpose of filters in digital signal processing is to reduce the noise which improves the performance of the signal and to extract the desired information from the signal. There are many different types of filters that are used to reduce the effects of noise. Like a low pass filter which takes the lower frequencies and rejects the higher frequencies, the FIR filter which allows low frequency components. These types of filters have been proposed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the information signal.
